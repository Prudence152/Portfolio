                 Dear You,<br><br>
I just wanted to let you know
that every time you walk into a room, I feel like time stops. It’s as if a soft light shines down on you, and your radiance and beauty blind me. I’m not often starstruck by someone, but you’re star-material, and you shine so brightly.</p><br>
<p>
It makes my pulse quicken and my heart race when I see you. You have this unique way of making me feel like I’m the only person in the room. It’s like time stands still, and all that matters is us; it feels electric, almost magical.</p><br>
<p>
I don’t know exactly what draws me to you, but I can’t ignore these feelings, and I am curious to explore where they could take us.

If you feel the same pull toward me, let’s explore what’s next for us. If your feelings match mine, I will be the happiest person in the world.
